    <h3 class="purple">A Hiking Pet is a Happy Pet</h3>
    <h4 class="dark-grey">Although your pet’s happiness is our #1 priority, we don’t want you to take our word on it. We wouldn’t. Instead, we want to prove our commitment in the only way we know how — by showcasing the families we’ve helped live out their adventures:</h4>
    <!-- Testimonial 1 - Ronnie & Toby -->
    <div class="testimonial-card-1">
      <div class=testimonial-frame></div>
      <h5 class="purple">Ronnie & Toby</h5>
      <p class="dark-grey">Toby loves going on hikes with me but can get too excitable at times and run off on his own, snapping his harness and taking hours to find. Muddy Paws’ dog harness is the first one that finally did the trick and could handle his enthusiasm. Now our hikes are better (and safer) than ever!</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Testimonial 2 - Debbie & Bingo -->
    <div class="testimonial-card-2">
      <div class=testimonial-frame></div>
      <h5 class="purple">Debbie & Bingo</h5>
      <p class="dark-grey">The only thing as big as Bingo’s sense of adventure is his stomach. He gets so hungry on our trips and getting his food out of my bag is always such a hassle. Thanks to Muddy Paws’ food storage attachment for his harness, now it’s incredibly easy to keep his stomach (and me) happy!</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Testimonial 3 - Jim & Pam -->
    <div class="testimonial-card-3">
      <div class=testimonial-frame></div>
      <h5 class="purple">Jim & Pam</h5>
      <p class="dark-grey">Pam loves going on hikes with me, but it can be a real adventure to get her to our hiking spots in the first place! Muddy Paws’ cat backpack was the perfect solution, letting me transport Pam to our favorite hiking spots without the usual scratches and protests. What a relief!</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Testimonial 4 - Jamie & Barney  -->
    <div class="testimonial-card-4">
      <div class=testimonial-frame></div>
      <h5 class="purple">Jamie & Barney</h5>
      <p class="dark-grey">Barney loves to scope out new spots for us to hike, but more than a few times now, he’s gotten overly enthusiastic and been really hard to find when he gets out ahead. Thankfully, Muddy Paws’ GPS tracker collar makes finding Barney a breeze, so now he can lead the way without giving me a heart attack!</p>
